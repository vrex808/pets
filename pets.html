    <h2>It may <em>appear</em> that they get along well, but little do we all know, they sort of do!</h2>
    <h2>What are their names?</h2>
    <p>We first got Rosie almost 8 years ago and then Ginseng came along super randomly as my family, including my father, started falling for him.</p>
    <p><em>Can you guess who is who, and who does what trick?</em></p> 
      <ul><h2>Some of their tricks they get into:</h2>
        <li>Fetch, but not really</li>
        <li>Learn how to use the toilet</li>
        <li>Chase the tail</li>
        <li>Interrogation tactics</li>
        <li>Operah singer</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>If you guessed right, Rosie is the pooch and Ginseng is the kitty!</h2>
    <p>Rosie loves to play fetch, but hasn't learned how to give it back. She'd rather play tug of war. Sometimes they both play that with each other.Interestingly, Ginseng somehow taught himself how to use the toilet one night. My guess was that his litter box was full so he had to resort another option. Sometimes, Rosie likes to chase her own tail, especially when she has no one else to play with. Both are great at interrogating new people in their household. And you guessed it, Rosie is a fantastic Operah singer!</p>

    <p>Thanks for dropping by and learning a little something about my pets!</p>
